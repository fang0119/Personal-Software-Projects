# Personal-Software-Projects
This is a repository for my Personal Software Projects, written in C++.

I made extensive use of the "library.h" library, a graphics library written for C++ by my Professor, Dr. Stephen Murrell, in order to facilitate graphical displays and GUI user interactions within my programs. 

Further information on this very useful graphics library can be found at: http://rabbit.eng.miami.edu/class/library/index.html

A Repository of the Python Scripts I wrote to solve the Code2040 Tech Assessment can be found at: https://github.com/fang0119/Code-2040
